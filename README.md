I run a bunch of websites these days.

Two of which have been built with react, which is the source of my current coding interests.

www.zxygallery.com is built on react and features the split-pane react feature.

www.nycsoundguy.com is built on react and relies heavily on react router.

www.chillcastle.com and is more about creating a mini-internet world that is hand drawn and feature lots of fun secret worlds.

www.internationalartmagazine.com is a art blog that features bootstrap css.

www.drinksfoodlife.com is a wordpress site.

Gracias por la visitaci√≥n.
