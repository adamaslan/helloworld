I am the creator of www.chillcastle.com and www.chillcoders.com

Both sites are aimed at helping my friends and chill people in general to expand their web presence by whatever resources we may have available.

Chill Castle is more about creating a mini-internet world where as chill coders is about creative connections between coders, helping coders find jobs, and spreading news about the accomplishments of particularly chill coders :)
